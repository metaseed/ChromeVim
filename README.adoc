== WebKey


== What is it?

Chrome extension empowering users to browse more with the keyboard  and less with the mouse.
It is a cVim fork adding more features



== Who is it for?

WebKey is dedicated to power users.

It follows Arch Linux philosophy by being *user-centric* not user-friendly. It is intended to fill the needs of those contributing to it rather than appeal to as many users as possible.

If you are familiar with vimperator/pentadactyl/vim, you will feel right at home. Otherwise, please consider using a beginner extension like vimium https://vimium.github.io/
